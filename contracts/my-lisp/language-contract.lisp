; Owner paradigm: #2490. Implementation cutover: #2817 / #2822.

; Contract 11 preserves the observable PredicateBit / ATOM / EQ / COND law
; ratified in Contract 10 while replacing the superseded flat Function8
; ontology with the current exact-domain ontology:
;
;   semantic object
;   = exact binary number
;   + exact domain
;   + proved / ratified law
;
; The exact Contract 10.0 source is preserved as NON-NORMATIVE provenance at:
;   docs/archive/historical/language-contract-10.0.lisp
;
; Historical Sens8/Sid8/Function8 machinery may remain only as explicitly
; bounded compatibility / transport / backend projection during migration.
; It cannot mint or redefine canonical semantic identity.

      (no-width-coercion
       . "Zero-padding, truncation, low-nibble extraction, integer equality, prefix resemblance, or any other width-changing transform cannot create or recover canonical domain identity. A compatibility projection is legal only when a separately stated role-aware law proves that exact projection.")
      (legacy-sens8-compatibility

They are not universal semantic identity and never compare equal to a domain-qualified object solely from packed bits.")
      (surface-non-authority

A surface may resolve mechanically to an already-admitted domain-qualified identity or an explicitly legacy compatibility projection; it never creates semantic identity, owns meaning, or becomes semantic authority.")
